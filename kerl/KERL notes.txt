General gameplay notes:

Stats:
	Health - Health/HP, non-regenerating (kinda want to not change a ton, maybe
		start ~50 and max at ~200) 
	Physical stamina - physical stamina used for physical actions (primarily 
		fighting), high regen when low fatigue
	Mental stamina (mana) - mental stamina used for spellcasting, high regen 
		when low fatigue
	Hunger - hunger slowly increases, eat food or eventually grow weak and die
	
	Fatigue - fatigue slowly increases, quickly increases when physical/mental 
		stamina are recovering, sleep/rest to recover or pass out

Speed:
	base time needed for most actions = 100 "ticks"
	multiplied by speed attribute

Skills:	
	Lots of skills for all weapon types, magic/ritual types, and general/
		survival skills	
	Two parts of a skill, "knowledge" and "ability"
		Knowledge: how much you know (theortical knowledge) about a skill
		Ability: how well you can actually perform the skill
	Knowledge gained from trainers/books, having knowledge makes increasing
		ability much faster at least as high as your ability
	Ability increases through using the skill, fairly quickly if knowledge is
		higher, very slow if equal increasing a skills knowledge increases 
		related skils knowledge somewhatusing a skill increases related 
		attributes

Magic:
	Two main forms of magic, rituals and spells.

	Rituals:
		Common magic type, everyone knows at least some
		Takes time "meditating" to cast
		Generally utility type spells
		Increase hunger and reduced stamina regen to cast/maintain
		Basic: healing, rest (while staying aware), creature detection
		Protection rituals (primary source for elemental resistances, 
			protection from death, etc...)
		Advanced: teleportation (begin with only recalling to home, then can 
			mark spots, at master can freely teleport to any explored location)
			plane shifting
	
	Spells:
		More specialized, only intelligent people use
		Takes "mental stamina" to cast (willpower?)
		Generally combat-oriented spells
		Has all your fire/ice/lightning spells etc...
		Higher level has plane shifting/teleportation 
			(very high willpower cost)
		
	Anti-magic:
		Many spells and rituals for resistance to vairous forms of magic 
			(or even physical) attack
		Anti-magic fields and null-magic stones that negate all magic within 
			their area of influence, (including items)
		Stones can be placed in a "lead box" to isolate the effect

Combat:
	Offense/Defense (with many modifiers) determines if and how solidly an 
		attack hits
	Damage/Armor (again with modifiers) determines damage sustained
	Many different styles or stances you can freely switch between
		defensive, offensive, group, etc...
	Fighting multiple enemies at once is a big deal
	Shield is much more than a simple armor boost
